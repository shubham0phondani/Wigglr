Wigglr is a dynamic, media-rich platform that lets users **discover, share, and embed** animated GIFs, stickers, and short looping media — in chats, social media, blogs, or web projects.  

It acts as a **searchable universe of motion and memes**, where every frame loops to express emotion, humor, or context without a single word.
